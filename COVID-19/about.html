                <p>Due to the damage caused by the virus to the lungs and other organs, the
                    body takes time to recover and get back to its former state. You should
                    reach out an occupational therapist for help in adjusting to your new
                    energy levels and limitations. Additionally, some of the things that could
                    help are<br>
                    • The daily check of oxygen saturation using pulse oximeter, it should be maintained at >94% in room air. <br>
                    • Patient must watch for persistence or worsening of cough and any difficulty in breathing. <br>
                    • The daily check of body temperature. <br>
                    • Regular monitoring of blood sugar in known diabetic patients. COVID infection (as any other infection) alters blood sugar levels of the body. Strict monitoring once in 3 days and regular consultation with your doctor is required. <br>
                    • Regular blood pressure monitoring in known hypertensive patients is required to avoid hypertension-related complications. <br>
                    • Take complete bed rest to reduce oxygen demand by the body. Do not exert yourself. <br>
                    • Increase intake of fluid in the form of water, coconut water, juices, soups and water containing fruits (Watermelon, muskmelon etc). Remember that better hydration leads to early recovery. <br>
                    • Consume protein rich food like milk, cottage cheese, peanuts, pulses, eggs, non-vegetarian etc. <br>
                    • Do breathing exercises, yoga and meditation to keep you calm and compose. <br>
                    • Do not exert more than required. More exertion will create more demand of oxygen. Take proper rest to decrease the oxygen demand. <br>
                    • Follow up consultation with the doctor within 7 days of discharge or as soon as if any symptoms like fever, intolerable cough or breathlessness happens. <br>
                    • Blood investigations like CBC at first follow up, and subsequent follow-ups, if advised by a physician. <br>
                    • Repeat CT scan of chest after three months to look at the extent of lung recovery post-infection, if advised by physician.</p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    • Taking support from your family members and friends.<br>
                    •  Take gradual steps towards regaining strength.<br>
                    • Re organizing some things in your life so they require less energy over
                    the next few weeks and months while you recover. Organizing daily
                    routines to allow completion of essential activities when you have
                    most energy.<br>
                    • Keep frequently used items in easily accessible places.<br>
                    • Don’t plan multiple activities for same day as it may cause fatigue.<br>
                    Keep low pace for doing activities so as to sustain energy level
                    throughout the activities.<br>
                    • Prioritize the activities- do only those which are absolute necessary.<br>
                    Eliminate unnecessary tasks and steps of activity.<br>
                    • Give plenty of rests in between the activities.<br>
                    • Store items at convenient level of height so as to avoid excessive
                    stretching. Keep optimum height of all work place surfaces.<br>
                    • Facilitate bathing by using shower seat/ hand held shower head.<br>
                    • Breathe easily and properly during the activities. Don’t do strenuous
                    activities which cause lot of physical exertion.<br>
